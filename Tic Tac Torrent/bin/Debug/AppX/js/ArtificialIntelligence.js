             * not exploit our mistake).

             * not necessarily worse than a previously made move, but may be equally as good as a
             * previously made move), but 'beta <= alpha' is more efficient, as it will more often
             * be true than 'beta < alpha', resulting in less nodes being searched. Therefore, the
             * algorithm is implemented using 'beta <= alpha' as the condition for pruning
             * branches.

             * would also find the best move but evaluate only 20866 nodes (taking say only 0.33
             * seconds).
